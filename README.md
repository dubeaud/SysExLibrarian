# SysExLibrarian
SysEx Librarian is an app to let your PC communicate with MIDI devices using System Exclusive messages, also known as SysEx. The most common use is to backup patch data from synthesizers, although there are others (such as sending firmware updates).

It is based on the Mac version of SysExLibrarian - https://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian
